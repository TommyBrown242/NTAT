Network Traffic Analysis Tool


This is an application that allows the user to monitor the traffic going through their machine in a network. Specifically, it looks for individual, or groups of, packets that seem suspicious.

The application does this by recording characteristics of previous analysises, i.e. time period of analysis, average rate of traffic, total number of captured packets. Additionally, the traffic is analysed for attack signatures of known attacks.
